Description: Use behavioural variables to score activity and infer sleep from bouts of immobility. 
    It is primarily designed to score sleep in fruit flies from DAM and Ethoscope data.
    It implements sleep scoring using the "five-minute rule" (<doi:10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80877-6>),
    activity classification for Ethoscope data (<doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003026>) 
    and a new algorithm to detect when animals are dead.
